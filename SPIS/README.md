## Overview
### neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com integrated scripts for Python 3.5.2 and Theano with CUDA support

These scripts are updated ones from the **neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com** gitHub repository in order to work with Python 3.5.2

## Sravya's Developments
-Scripts are modified for user input functionality and user input image processing for testing dataset

-Run "expand_mnist" to insert new testing image

-Run "runner" to see network's output + accuracy

## Further Work
-Image consistency in uploading

-Number segmentation

-Letter segmentation
